                        <p><b>ADVENTURE BOOKS : </b>You all know that we are fans of reading adventure books. They are like invisible zip lines for your mind If you haven't read the adventure series, the Growly Trilogy, you simply must. Blaine and I have fallen in love with this series and we demanded suggested that we share them here at Sassafras Science. 'Cause we didn't want our peeps to miss out on them!
                    But not only do we get to share these books with you, but we also get to share a wonderful post from their author, Phil Ulrich. Let's get rolling... A good adventure story has the ability to draw us into a world we might otherwise never explore. We come to care about the characters and the things that are important to them. We visit places we would normally never choose to go and sometimes glimpse a little spark of adventure inside us we didn’t know was there. We start to feel like we’re along for the ride too, and we find that we can’t wait to see what’s just around the next corner</p>
                   <p><b>COMIC BOOKS   </b>Comic books are like a book consisting of a lot of “Pictures Illustration”. That is, your ability to absorb knowledge in a comic book will be much higher than reading a regular book.
                          
                    The dense appearance of text in books will often give you a headache if you look at it for a long time. It’s too difficult to absorb a lot of information at once. But if the information is in images, you will find it easier to absorb it.</p>   </section>
